# Configuration for Solid Queue
# Solid Queue uses the primary database connection by default

# In development/test, Solid Queue is disabled or uses async adapter (no DB needed)
# In staging/production, Solid Queue uses the primary database connection by default
# Only configure connects_to if using a separate queue database (not used in this project)

# No configuration needed - Solid Queue will use the primary database connection
# This works for both staging and production
